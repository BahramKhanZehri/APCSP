<h2>My Many Projects</h1> 
<p>I have made many projects in both Python and Javascript. You can find a few linked here. Such as, my times table project for children so that they may better understand the times table, or my password detector to demonstrate how computers use passwords, by storing variables and checking input against them. Additionally, I made a shopping list in case you want to bring your computer to the grocery store.<p>
