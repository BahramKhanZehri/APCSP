<h2> Salutations! </h1> 
<p> My name is Bahram Khan Zehri. I currently attend the AP Computer Science Principles class in HKIS. As per the wishes of my class, I have created a website that exists as a portfolio, showcasing my skills with Html, Javascript, as well as CSS. You may use the buttons to go to other pages on my website.<p>
